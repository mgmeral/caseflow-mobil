# CaseFlow Mobile

React Native + TypeScript mobile client foundation for the CaseFlow platform.

## Current scope

This repository now bootstraps the **Phase 1 foundation** described in the implementation plan:

- Expo-based React Native app with a single shared codebase
- React Navigation app shell
- TanStack Query setup for server state
- Zustand session store backed by `expo-secure-store`
- JWT login + refresh-ready API client for the existing `caseflow-be` contract
- Domain-oriented source structure
- Initial mobile screens for Home, Cases, Inbox, Customers, Notifications, and Profile
- Read-only case detail and conversation foundation
- Jest + React Native Testing Library setup

## Environment

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and set the backend URL:

```bash
cp /home/runner/work/caseflow-mobil/caseflow-mobil/.env.example /home/runner/work/caseflow-mobil/caseflow-mobil/.env
```

Example values:

```env
EXPO_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8080/api
EXPO_PUBLIC_ENABLE_AI=true
EXPO_PUBLIC_ENABLE_PUSH=false
```

## Scripts

```bash
npm start
npm run android
npm run ios
npm run web
npm run typecheck
npm test
```

## Auth model

This mobile client currently follows the **existing backend auth contract**:

- `POST /api/auth/login`
- `POST /api/auth/refresh`
- `POST /api/auth/logout`
- `GET /api/auth/me`

It does **not** implement OIDC/PKCE because the backend does not currently expose that flow.

## Notes

- Inbox tab is shown only when the signed-in user has `ADMIN_POOL_VIEW`.
- Conversation rendering currently adapts the backend's email-thread contract.
- Push notifications and reply attachments remain backend-dependent follow-up work.
